When we are working on desman code 
==================================
(first use sudo -s so that password will not ask again otherwise use "sudo" for each git command and enter password)

Here we have two servers gitlab and devel. First when we commit code and push to gitlab server and again we need to pull that code to devel server from gitlab server after john does the merge request.

Every day check for new commits on gitlab server and pull the code to devel
   git checkout to devel
   git pull origin devel (*** we should only devel to devel branch not to any branch)
After that rebase the code to your branch
   git checkout to your branch	
   git rebase devel
All the commits are now on your branch(means you have latest code on your branch, head pointing to your branch)



1) we need to create a new branch on devel for that first we need to checkout to devel branch
   git checkout devel
2)After that we need to create new branch and checkout to that branch
   git branch feature/branch-name
or
   git checkout -b feature/branch-name ( this will automatically create branch and also checkout to that branch)
3)once coding is completed we need to commit the code 
   git commit -a ( add comment for that branch)
4)git push -u origin feature/branch-name (to gitlab server)
5)Raise merge request to john so that john will review code and merge that new branch to devel (in gitlab server)
6) And once merge request is completed pull gitlab server devel branch to devel server devel branch

when you want to remove the pulled code on git use
git checkout filename (it will remove modified files)

when rebasing the code and found code is already there written by someone just use
git rebase --skip




Desman Worker restart
=====================
sudo docker ps -a(all containers)

docker start prime-worker (if it is in exited status)

docker stop prime-worker

sudo docker rm prime-worker


docker exec -it prime-worker bash 

sudo docker build -t inetu/test-worker:0.0.0 .

sudo docker images


How to work on perl code (Sftp server only)
==========================================
1) copy the worker folder from desman/Vendor/inetu to any folder in sftp sever
2) make changes to the perl code 
3) build docker image for changed perl code in sftp server

   sudo docker build -t inetu/test-worker:0.0 . (last dot is regarding if perl code is in same directroy or need to mention the path of the docker file)

4) If encountring any issue with docker image build copy paste the dcoker file configuration already exist in worker-test folder
5) get the openshift token 
6) Delete existing docker container ---- sudo docker rm prime-worker
7) run the docker container after copy & pasting the token using docker run command
8) If it is created but not up check for logs ---- sudo docker logs prime-worker
 
curl -k -X POST -u "prime-worker:hUB(N@E[Dcuseu" --data "scopes=session" https://m4d-bkr.ccs.inetu.org/broker/rest/user/authorizations/

sudo docker run -dt -h prime-worker   --name prime-worker     -v /etc/sssd:/etc/sssd:ro     -v /etc/prime-worker.conf:/etc/desman-worker.conf:ro      -v /var/lib/sss:/var/lib/sss:ro   -v /var/log/prime-worker/:/var/log/desman/     -v /srv/sftp:/srv/sftp      -e HOST_IP_ADDR=`perl -mNet::Address::IP::Local -e 'print Net::Address::IP::Local->public;'`     -e GITLAB_HOST=https://gitlab.ccs.inetu.org   -e OPENSHIFT_BROKER=https://m4d-bkr.ccs.inetu.org     -e OPENSHIFT_TOKEN=91bf6d77fcae6c18d773c012c7c2feb912e6ff8475403030f843bf822c5a48fb    -e GITLAB_PRIVATE_TOKEN=vGRTBkKSpKpsmiG1BssS     inetu/ragtest-worker:1.3




To remove unwanted changes in file
==================================
 git checkout -- WebsitesController.php

Archer system token expires
===========================
2016-04-26 06:19:38 Error: OH No...
2016-04-26 06:19:38 Error: Server was unable to process request. ---> Invalid session token
so when token expires we have to clear the cache and enable debug mode which create the cache again and than disable the debug mode

Git rebase
============
u have to rebase ur branch to devel as well as devel has so many commit which your branch doesn't have
we should use rebase when for eg. I was working on abc branch which I created from devel but now devel has some more code , in this case now to sync my abc branch with devel I will do rebase so that new changes which are in devel should also come into my branch .

we always rebase from devel not from master

a. commit the code in branch
b. push the code to git (git push -u origin bugfix/preview-docker)
c. checkout to devel branch
1. pull changes on devel (git pull -u origin bugfix/preview-docker)
2. checkout to your branch
3. rebase to devel

Check Devel server is upto date with gitlab server
==================================================
ok so make sure before creating branch from devel that devel has latest code or devel branch on devel server should be in same state as devel branch on gitlab server .. if not you have to pull the changes first and than create new branch

pull code into devel branch on devel server if it is not up to date with gitlab server
[4:07:04 PM] Pardeep Singh: you can do git log in devel branch on devel server and see commits on devel branch on gitlab server
[4:07:32 PM] Pardeep Singh: ifgitlab server has more commits than pull the code


how to check perl worker logs
=============================
first login in sftp server
cd /var/log/prime-worker/vim worker.log 

to check at run time
cd /var/log/prime-worker/tail -f worker.log 

cat worker.log |grep -i "qatest554.com"

Git commands
============
git config --global http.sslVerify false
git clone https://gitlab.ccs.inetu.org/inetu/desman.git

$ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]

[psingh@inetuc-desman01 desman]$ git push -u origin bugfix/preview-docker

 * [new branch]      bugfix/preview-docker -> bugfix/preview-docker
Branch bugfix/preview-docker set up to track remote branch bugfix/preview-docker from origin.
[psingh@inetuc-desman01 desman]$ cd /var/www/prime/desman-2
[psingh@inetuc-desman01 desman-2]$ git pull -u origin bugfix/preview-docker
error: cannot open .git/FETCH_HEAD: Permission denied

1)first git push the branch from desman to git
 git push -u origin bugfix/preview-docker
2)create a branch for the first time and pull the branch from git
sudo git checkout -b origin/bugifx/preview-docker bugifx/preview-docker
3)now pull the code from git branch
 sudo git pull origin bugfix/preview-docker


first time we have to fetch new branch from remote repo using
---------------------------------------
git fetch origin/bugifx/preview-docker
---------------------------------------
then we have to create a branch from remotely fetched repo using
--------------------------------------------------------------
git branch -b origin/bugifx/preview-docker bugifx/preview-docker
--------------------------------------------------------------
now u have local branch which is tracking/linked to remote branch of same name

git history
============
git log



mysql commands
==============
Prime MysQL
-----------
mysql -u prime_desmandb --database prime_desmandb -p
pwd: ata>&ywOpdK5dh

Prime2 MySQL
------------
mysql -u pardeep -h 10.110.3.20 -p
Password: root
Database Name: prime_desmandb2

When JS files are changed we need to run following command
===========================================================
[3:58:49 PM] Manish Garg: you need to run the following command in the webroot/js folder
[3:58:56 PM] Manish Garg: sudo r.js -o build.js
[3:59:17 PM | Edited 3:59:51 PM] Manish Garg: after that changes will reflect there..
If we change any js file we need to run this command?
[4:00:25 PM] Manish Garg: just not in case of obs
[4:00:52 PM] Manish Garg: i.e. chnages related to obs files in javascript


Coding Standards
================
[6:37:07 PM] Manish Garg: please insure that ur code follow the standards as mentioned in mail and and push code to gitlab
[6:37:22 PM] Manish Garg: no need to create merge request now, just push branch
[6:37:52 PM] Manish Garg: also, remove the DeploymentController's watch name changes before commiting
[6:38:27 PM] Manish Garg: and run git diff command before commiting to review the changes u have done
[6:38:48 PM] Manish Garg: so that no new line changes or whitespace changes get commited,
[6:39:07 PM] Manish Garg: only the changes which u done knowingly should be committed

# Edit hello.py and main.py
git add hello.py
git commit

# Realize you forgot to add the changes from main.py
git add main.py
git commit --amend --no-edit





To clear cache
==============
rm -rf tmp/cache/*
[6:30:22 PM] Manish Garg: There is one more thing that you need to do when you clean cache, as you will notice that after clearing cache website won't open..
->you need to go to Config/core.php file, and there will be this line(39):
   Configure::write('debug',0);
->You need to change 0 to 2. i.e:
   Configure::write('debug',2);
->Then refresh the prime-desman page, it will be loaded now.
-> Again change 2 to 0 in Config/core.php i/e:
   Configure::write('debug',0);
-> everything done.
[6:30:30 PM | Edited 6:31:31 PM] Manish Garg: please note these steps
[6:30:42 PM] Manish Garg: after running sudo rm -rf tmp/cache/*

To have view in devel button (temporary fix)
============================
in deployment controller we need to add "prime-" desman-marathon-watch at line 201
and in line 1374 we need to add code if ($this->getAppStatus($marathonAppId)) {
    if (!$this->Deployment->current($id, $deployment_data['Deployment']['district'])) {
       throw new CakeException("Failed to set current status for deployment $id");
    }

git process
============
Do work on a web site.

Create a branch for a new story you’re working on.

Do some work in that branch.

At this stage, you’ll receive a call that another issue is critical and you need a hotfix. You’ll do the following:

Switch to your production branch.

Create a branch to add the hotfix.




DELETE T
FROM events T
INNER JOIN deployments on deployments.id = T.deployment_id
WHERE deployments.website_id in (1078,1086,1092,1093,1094,1095);

delete from deployments where website_id in (1078,1086,1092,1093,1094,1095);
delete from stores where website_id in (1078,1086,1092,1093,1094,1095);
delete from webdbs where website_id in (1078,1086,1092,1093,1094,1095);
delete from websites where id in (1078,1086,1092,1093,1094,1095);

delete from aliases where website_id in (1078,1086,1092,1093,1094,1095);
delete from assessments where application_id in (203053,155313,157999,138985,119631,119697,119652);


After it’s tested, merge the hotfix branch, and push to production.

Switch back to your original story and continue working.
